## Plans (codex-plan-ledger)

In Plan mode, end every planning reply with a complete `<proposed_plan>` block, including
the first one. Do not stop at a draft, a summary or a list of questions: when a choice is
still open, write the plan with your recommended option and list the choice under
`## Decisions` instead of asking about it. The user answers every decision at once on a
page and replies with a `plan-ledger answers` message; then output the revised plan.

Format of `## Decisions` (one list item per open choice):

- D1: <the question>
  - <option> (Recommended)
  - <option>
  - Affects: <files or globs this choice changes>

Keep listing a decision with its options until the user has answered it. Do not mark
decisions as resolved yourself. After a `plan-ledger answers` message, drop the answered
decisions from `## Decisions` and state the chosen options in the plan body.
